Tic Tac Toe Game Command Line Interface
cli.py: This is the file that contains the Command Line Interface (CLI) for the tic-tac-toe game. This file dictates the inputs and outputs of the game.
use your game winning logic function from earlier
show the board to the user in the command line
accept an input from a user
update the board and test if someone wins
update who's turn is next
The files we will complete later, which you DO NOT need to work on now are:

logic.py: This is the file that contains the core logic for the tic-tac-toe game. These functions should be imported to the cli.py  to implement the game logic. 
tests.py: This is the file that contains the unit tests for the logic of the game. All the functions written in the logic.py should be tested here. A starter test is given for your reference.
